Examples:\n\n```\nstruct Something;\n\nimpl Something {} // ok!\n\n// or:\n\ntrait Foo {\n    type N;\n\n    fn bar(_: Self::N); // ok!\n}\n\n// or:\n\nfn foo<T>(x: T) {} // ok!\n```\n\nAnother case that causes this error is when a type is imported into a parent\nmodule. To fix this, you can follow the suggestion and use File directly or\n`use super::File;` which will import the types from the parent namespace. An\nexample that causes this error is below:\n\n```compile_fail,E0412\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    fn some_function(f: File) {}\n}\n```\n\n```\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nmod foo {\n    // either\n    use super::File;\n    // or\n    // use std::fs::File;\n    fn foo(f: File) {}\n}\n# fn main() {} // don't insert it for us; that'll break imports\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/arbaiter/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/thiserror-impl-1.0.69/src/attr.rs","byte_start":889,"byte_end":915,"line_start":30,"line_end":30,"column_start":1,"column_end":27,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"pub struct Transparent<'a> {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":27}],"label":"similarly named struct `Transparent` defined here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/home/arbaiter/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/thiserror-impl-1.0.69/src/attr.rs","byte_start":2952,"byte_end":2963,"line_start":98,"line_end":98,"column_start":21,"column_end":32,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            let kw: transparent = input.parse()?;","highlight_start":21,"highlight_end":32}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"a struct with a similar name exists","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/arbaiter/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/thiserror-impl-1.0.69/src/attr.rs","byte_start":2952,"byte_end":2963,"line_start":98,"line_end":98,"column_start":21,"column_end":32,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"            let kw: transparent = input.parse()?;","highlight_start":21,"highlight_end":32}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"Transparent","suggestion_applicability":"MaybeIncorrect","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0412]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: cannot find type `transparent` in this scope\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0m/home/arbaiter/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/thiserror-impl-1.0.69/src/attr.rs:98:21\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m30\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0mpub struct Transparent<'a> {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--------------------------\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12msimilarly named struct `Transparent` defined here\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m...\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m98\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m            let kw: transparent = input.parse()?;\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m                     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mhelp: a struct with a similar name exists: `Transparent`\u001b[0m\n\n"}
